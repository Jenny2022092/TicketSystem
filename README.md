# TicketSystem

In this Ticket system program, the detail of the user is being saved in a list that mainly contains the staff id, name, email address, and description. All these parameters are sent in the submitTicket function where these queries are entertained and finally, the program displays the Ticket statistics which contain the total no of tickets, the total no of resolved tickets, and no of tickets to solve.
